## Status

It works on my machine...

It is an absolute dogs and birds implementation using global variables and tables for layout and no error catching what so ever. But it runs on the GPU and is pretty fast.

## Outlook

As is usually the case, it took 10x as long to implement as I thought, so I am absolutely fed up with it and will probably not implement any feature requests in the near future. PRs are welcome however.
